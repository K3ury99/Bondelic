# Pagina-de-Ana
> [!NOTE]
This is a page that I made in my beginnings as a programmer, this is a page of a famous pastry shop in my town made with HTML, CSS and a little Javascript, it contains carousels with images of cakes, a menu, information about the pastry and some Gif. PS: Don't watch this when you're hungry. :)

<!-- En resumen, solo se sube la imagen y se toma el URL para editarlo, y se utiliza display flex para agregarlas una al lado de la otra ajustando el width -->
<div style="display: flex;">

When I made this website I was starting this world of programming, I was only 15 years old!
