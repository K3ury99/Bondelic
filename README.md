# Pagina-de-Ana
 This is a page that I made in my beginnings as a programmer, this is a page of a famous pastry shop in my town made with HTML, CSS and a little Javascript, it contains carousels with images of cakes, a menu, information about the pastry and some Gif. PS: Don't watch this when you're hungry. :)
